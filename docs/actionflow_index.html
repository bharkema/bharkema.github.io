                <p>The actionflow editor works as an BPMN editor and is made for developpers and data scientist to work with the editor to make the site interactive and to calculate and predict on the go.</p>
                <h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>
                <p>The actionflow editor works on a few principles that are handy to understand for debugging and communication.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Condition node aka &quot;task&quot; </li>
                </ul>
                <p>A condition node is the square that is visible when adding a new type of task from the addwindow. the condition node exists out of a square and an icon representing what type of condition node it is.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Decision node</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The decision node defines a point where the API needs to make a decision for the worker on what task to execute next. 
                in the decision node you can also input settings to define where to go when a certain statement is met. you can see this here:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Notes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To help creating clarity in you actionflow you can create notes with descriptions within them to see what a certain condition node is for and what script is being used for example</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Global settings</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Global settings are made to send data that will be default to the worker. by using global data you can for example define a collection that you always wish to update when the action flow is ending.</p>
                <h1 id="types-of-condition-nodes">Types of condition nodes</h1>
                <ul>
                <li>AI Prediction    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using AI prediction you can use a AI model to create a prediction on the data you wish to execute.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Execute Python Script    aka &quot;Actionflow task&quot;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By using this you can let a custom python script excute</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Execute Data Import    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using this task you can create a data import where you can upload either custom data or data that you have scraped in a earlier task.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Send notification    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can send a notification to one of the following: Mail, SMS, Whatsapp, Site notification. This will create a notification to notify the person you wish to contact about the actionflow.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Insert/update record    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on conditions you can either insert or update a record in a collection</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Call External API    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can call an external API and the return will be saved as a temporary variable to be able to execute with the actionflow</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Execute Action Flow    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>you can call another actionflow to start execution</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Retrain AI Model    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>it can be the case an AI model needs to be retrained by calling this function this can be automated</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Web Hook    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can use a webhook to send a message or call a function on a site to update a datatable for example.</p>
